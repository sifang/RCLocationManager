Example:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\nRCLocationManager *locationManager = [[RCLocationManager alloc] initWithUserDistanceFilter:kCLLocationAccuracyHundredMeters userDesiredAccuracy:kCLLocationAccuracyBest purpose:@\"My custom purpose message\" delegate:self];\r\n```\r\n- Check the header file for all the things you can customize.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n```RCLocationManager``` requires your application to be linked against the ```CoreLocation.framework``` framework.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n- Supports ARC. If you want to use it in a project without ARC, mark ```RCLocationManager.m``` with the linker flag ```-fobjc-arc```.\r\n\r\n##Credits\r\n\r\nThanks to [Alejandro Martinez](https://twitter.com/alexito4) for his help :)\r\n\r\n## License\r\nCopyright 2012 [Ricardo Caballero](http://twitter.com/rcabamo) (hello@rcabamo.es)\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n limitations under the License. \r\n\r\nAttribution is not required, but appreciated.","name":"Rclocationmanager","tagline":"Easy Location Manager"}
